##Part of U.C. Berkeley's "CS188.1x: Artificial Intelligence" Online Course Projects on edX 


(1) Design and implement Search-based A.I. Agent on a Pac-man game (implemented in Python programming language), 
for eating all foods or going to goal position(s) in a maze, using various search methods: 

• Depth-First Search <br/>
• Breadth-First Search <br/>
• Uniform Cost Search <br/>
• A* Search (including the heuristics)

(2) Design and implement Multi-Agent Systems on a Pac-man game, using various methods:

• MiniMax (Pac-man as the Max-Agent and Ghosts as the Min-Agents) <br/>
• MiniMax with Alpha-Beta Pruning  <br/>
• ExpectiMax (Pac-man as the Max-Agent and Ghosts as the Chance-Agents)
